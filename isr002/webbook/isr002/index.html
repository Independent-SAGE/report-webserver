        <h2>What is the Independent SAGE?</h2>
        <p>‘We are following the science’ is the message the British public have been hearing from government since COVID-19 mitigating measures began. It says it is following the advice of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE). But the activities of the committee have been kept secret and excluded from scrutiny by the public or wider scientific community.</p>
        <p>In response, on Monday May 4, the Independent SAGE convened as a group of preeminent experts from the UK and around the world. The aim of the Independent SAGE was and is to provide robust, independent advice to HM Government with the purpose of helping the UK navigate COVID-19 whilst minimising fatalities.</p>
        <p>The Independent SAGE is chaired by former HM Government Chief Scientific Advisor Sir David King and draws on a range of international and British experts.</p>
        <p><strong>What did the Independent SAGE discuss?</strong><br>The Independent SAGE i​nvestigated seven key poi​nts to make constructive recommendations to support the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>What are the criteria for lifting lockdown?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>How can testing and tracing be successfully achieved?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Are the policies on quarantine and the shielding of vulnerable groups sufficient?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What social distancing policies will be required in the future? In particular, on school closures and public gatherings</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What port and border controls are required?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Where does responsibility lie for managing the pandemic? Are all levels of government being utilised effectively, is the response by central government delivered vertically failing?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The UK has enormous globally recognised untapped resources that should be called on, such as the Royal Society and Academies, manufacturers, etc. How do we bring these into the picture much more effectively? Will we manufacture the vaccines we and the world needs in the UK?</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In response to these questions, the Independent SAGE assessed measures to date, asked whether the strategy has been effective to date and reviewed what approached they believed should be adopted to minimise deaths, ending the pandemic as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>The approach of the committee is to provide a set of recommendations from this first meeting. It will be based on minimising deaths and ending the epidemic as soon as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>What will the outcomes be?</strong><br>The Independent SAGE will provide a series of evidence-based recommendations for the UK government based on global best practice.</p>
        <p><strong>What is the format?</strong><br>The Independent SAGE will engage in an open debate on the topics on the agenda. This evidence session was live streamed on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqqwC56XTP8F9zeEUCOttPQ/featured">Youtube</a>&nbsp;so the public can see the evidence presented and understand the debate within the scientific community on the most appropriate course of action for the UK government.</p>
        <h2 id="H599415"><strong>Members of the Independent SAGE committee</strong></h2>
        <h3>CHAIR</h3><p><strong>Sir David Anthony King</strong><br>Former Government&nbsp;CSA; founder and Chair, Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge; Senior Strategy Adviser to the President of Rwanda; Chair of Independent SAGE</p>
        <h3>Members</h3>
        <p><strong>Professor Gabriel Scally</strong><br>President of Epidemiology &amp; Public Health section, Royal Society of Medicine</p>
        <p><strong>Professor Allyson Pollock</strong><br>Co-director of the Newcastle University Centre for Excellence in Regulatory Science.</p>
        <p><strong>Professor Anthony Costello</strong><br>Professor of Global Health and Sustainable Development, University College London; former Director at WHO</p>
        <p><strong>Professor Karl Friston&nbsp;</strong>FRS<br>Computational modeller and neuroscientist at UCL in charge of developing a generative SEIR COVID19 model</p>
        <p><strong>Professor Susan Michie</strong><br>Professor of Health Psychology and Director of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/behaviour-change">Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London</a>, member of SPI(B), SAGE sub-committee</p>
        <p><strong>Professor Deenan Pillay</strong><br>Professor of Virology UCL, former SAGE member</p>
        <p><strong>Professor Kamlesh Khunti</strong><br>Professor of Primary Care &amp; Diabetes, University of Leicester</p>
        <p><strong>Professor</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Christina Pagel</strong><br>Mathematician and professor of operational research, UCL&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Dr Zubaida Haque</strong>&nbsp;FRSA<br>Interim Director, Runnymede Trust</p>
        <p><strong>Professor Martin McKee</strong><br>Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</p>
        <p><strong>Dr Alison Pittard</strong><br>Dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, UK</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>In addition, there is also:</p>
        <p><strong>The Independent SAGE Behavioural Advisory Group</strong></p>
        <p>A new Behavioural Advisory Group has been formed to contribute to the discussions, advice and papers of Independent SAGE.</p>
        <p>The formation of the group recognises the central role of the behavioural and social sciences in the response to Covid-19. Every measure to counter the spread of infection is dependent upon the understanding, engagement and adherence to guidance of the public, whether that be self-isolating, social distancing, practising self-protective behaviours such as hand cleansing, getting tested or (eventually) getting vaccinated.</p>
        <p>In order to gain the adherence of the public to pandemic control measures, it is critical that the authorities are trusted. For this to happen, both central and local authorities must involve all sections of the public as partners in all stages of the development, delivery and assessment of policies.</p>
        <p>Equally, it is crucial to consider the impact of every policy and practice on practices on all sections of the public, especially those who are most vulnerable, with a view to reducing inequalities. Diversity is central to the thinking, procedures and membership of our new group.</p>
        <p>Our focus, however, is not limited to the behaviour of the public. We will also address that of policy-makers, planners, and health and social care workers. They are all part of a complex system of people and organisations needed to address the problem. Getting the right policies involves understanding the capability, opportunity and motivations of people in all parts of society.</p>
        <p>The Independent SAGE Behavioural Advisory Group includes leading authorities in anthropology, behavioural sciences, criminology, health studies and psychology. Some of the members also participate in UK-wide and Scottish government advisory groups. Its role is complementary, not an alternative, to these other roles. It will support Independent SAGE in looking in depth at key policy issues, including ones not currently on the government’s agenda.</p>
        <p>The Behavioural Advisory Group aims to help in the development of constructive proposals and policies that will help the UK Government lead the country out of the worst public health crisis of our lifetime.
