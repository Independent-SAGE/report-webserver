National Education Union Criteria for Schools Re-opening</h2><p>Test 1 : <strong>Much lower numbers of Covid-19 cases </strong>The new case count must be much lower than it is now, with a sustained downward trend and confidence that new cases are known and counted promptly. And the Government must have extensive arrangements for testing and contact tracing to keep it that way.</p><p>Test 2 : <strong>A national plan for social distancing </strong>The Government must have a national plan including parameters for both appropriate physical distancing and levels of social mixing in schools, as well as for appropriate PPE, which will be locally negotiated at school-by-school and local authority level.</p><p>Test 3 : <strong>Testing, testing, testing! </strong>Comprehensive access to regular testing for children and staff to ensure our schools and colleges don’t become hot spots for Covid-19.</p><p>Test 4 : <strong>Whole school strategy </strong>Protocols to be put in place to test a whole school or college when a case occurs and for isolation to be strictly followed.</p><p>Test 5 : <strong>Protection for the vulnerable. </strong>Vulnerable staff, and staff who live with vulnerable people, must work from home, fulfilling their professional duties to the extent that is possible. Plans must specifically address the protection of vulnerable parents, grandparents and carers.</p><h2 id="H4009908">2. Uncertainty levels for the risk of contagion</h2><p>The following graphic illustrates the uncertainty that attends the predictions of risk (here, the risk of contagion). This is probably too much detail for the consultation document but could be used to reassure people that a formal risk analysis could be pursued if and when necessary. The graph below shows when we would expect the risk of contagion to fall below 1% (broken line) based upon UK averages. This analysis could be repeated for regional data (e.g., time series of new cases and deaths).</p><figure data-equation="" data-image="229" data-figure-category="none" data-caption="" id="F10910041" data-aligned="center" data-width="100" class="aligned-center image-width-100" data-image-src="/media/images/ed2c3f8e-80b3-4a5c-8af3-7f0aaede1a0d.png"><div><a href="images/ed2c3f8e-80b3-4a5c-8af3-7f0aaede1a0d.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/ed2c3f8e-80b3-4a5c-8af3-7f0aaede1a0d.png" style="break-before: avoid;"></a></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>From the point of view of the epidemiology, June 1 stands in for 52 days following the peak of infections (10 April for London). This means ‘June 1’ is the earliest date at which risk may be acceptable for some areas. <strong>Other areas could defer their ‘June 1st’ in relation to their local experience</strong>.</p><h2 id="H1693846">3.
