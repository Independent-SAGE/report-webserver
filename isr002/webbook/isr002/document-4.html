These range from staggering opening by year groups, smaller class sizes, outdoor teaching and variable start times through to personal protection, physical distancing, and regular handwashing including, of course, for teachers and other staff at school.</p><p>However, the crucial factor allowing school reopening around the world has been the presence of well-functioning local test, trace and isolate protocols—something that is now accepted will not be in place in England by early June. Each school will vary in terms of layout, ventilation, and numbers of available staff which will determine precisely which infection control procedures are feasible or not. We note that school opening in other countries, such as Denmark, has been preceded by substantial investment in measures such as additional washing facilities to promote safety.</p><p>Key measures need to be in place to ensure safety, and each school needs to consult widely with teachers, unions, parents, local authorities including public health for local intelligence on infectivity, education departments and inspectors and children before proposing how best to open the school to the proposed additional full classes.</p><h2 id="H5852222">4.2 Community</h2><p>We recognise that schools will start to open while social distancing guidance remains in place. Issues which require clear guidance include transportation to school, collection of children at the school gates, often by childminders, grandparents, and other carers, and how staff and children can best minimise potential transmission of infection in households and communities. Consideration will need to be given to family members being from vulnerable groups and being shielded and for multigenerational family households. Schools need to work with the local communities to develop specific protocols suited to the local environment (for instance, a village school faces different challenges than an inner city one). Dealing with children’s anxiety about social distancing also requires careful consideration.</p></div><section class="fnlist" role="doc-footnotes"></section>
