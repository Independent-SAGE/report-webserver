Preserving Education in the Summer and If Schools Stay Closed</div><div class="article-part article-heading article-subtitle" data-hidden="true"></div><div class="article-part article-contributors article-authors" data-hidden="true"></div><div class="article-part article-richtext article-abstract" data-hidden="true"></div><div class="article-part article-tags article-keywords" data-hidden="true"></div><div class="article-part article-richtext article-body"><h2 id="H3880387">6.1 Wifi and online education</h2><p>A major concern is to provide opportunities for pupils in state schools who may not have access to wifi, computers, tablets or smartphones if education is forced to move largely online. In a digital world we believe every child in school aged seven and above should have access to these facilities. Options for requisitioning independent schools, academy schools, church halls, sports clubs, football stadiums and other facilities should be considered to provide socially distanced facilities for all children.</p><p>We must also support children from families who find home schooling difficult for other reasons (such as not having English as a first language).</p><h2 id="H1762773">6.2 Summer camps and open-air education</h2><p>Local authorities and civil society groups should be mobilised to provide <strong>summer schools and camps </strong>to help with educational “catch up”, particularly for those most disadvantaged by the lockdown, and also to provide some respite for parents and carers. This presents a major opportunity for community engagement and potentially the use of some of the 750,000 volunteers.</p><p>Use of sports grounds, football, rugby and other stadia and hire of marquees will provide opportunities for exercise and socially distanced education for children. If teachers are not available, trained coaches and approved supervisors would be needed for these activities including music and drama.</p><p>Governments have a duty to provide the <strong>investment and resources </strong>for schools and staff, for reduced class sizes, and, where schools do not open or open partially, to take steps to provide alternatives to ensure meaningful education that meets the needs of all children <em>.</em><br></p><h2 id="H8504149">6.3 Hidden hunger</h2><p>We remain concerned about the level of hidden hunger among children from poorer households, with parents who are on benefits or in low-paid employment . According to <strong><a href="https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/IWP_2017_09.pdf">UNICEF</a></strong>, in 2017, 10% of children in the UK were living in households affected by severe food insecurity. According to <strong><a href="http://endhungeruk.org/shocking-figures-showing-hidden-hunger-show-need-find/">figures</a></strong> published by <strong><a href="http://endhungeruk.org/">End Hunger UK</a></strong>, in January 2018 16% of adults in Great Britain either skipped or saw someone else in their household skip meals; 14% of adults worried about not having enough food to eat; and 8% of adults had gone a whole day without eating because of a lack of money during the last 12 months.</p><p>Provision of midday meals for vulnerable children out of school and during the summer months is essential, supported by government, local authorities or via civil society organisations.</p><h2 id="H7958450">6.4 WHO Check Lists</h2><p>We suggest that schools consider using the checklists for parents and children and for students as suggested by the Word Health Organisation regarding Actions for COVID-19 Prevention and Control in Schools.
