In the most deprived schools, 15% of teachers report that more than a third of their students learning from home would not have adequate access to an electronic device for learning, compared to only 2% in the most affluent state schools. <strong>12% of those in the most deprived schools also felt that more than a third of their students would not have adequate internet access.</strong></p><p>A <a href="https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14848" title="https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14848">recent report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies</a> also highlighted the disproportionate impact on deprived areas. Higher-income parents are much more likely than the less well-off to report that their child’s school provides online classes and access to online videoconferencing with teachers. 82% of secondary independent school pupils are offered active help, with 79% being provided with online classes. 64% of secondary pupils in state schools from the richest households are being offered active help from schools, such as online teaching, compared with just 47% from the poorest fifth of families.</p><p><strong>Moreover 60% of independent schools and 37% of schools in the highest income areas had an online platform to receive work, compared to 23% in the most deprived schools</strong>. 45% of students had communicated with their teachers in the last week. At independent schools, the figure is 62% for primaries and 81% for secondaries.</p><p>The decision of many independent schools to open in September demonstrates their ability to prioritise infection prevention, but only in the context of ongoing high quality on-line educational opportunities for their pupils.</p><h2 id="H5666729">3.2 Access to facilities</h2><p>It is clear that existing stark inequalities in educational opportunities for children are being further widened through the COVID-19 pandemic, in parallel with the clear excess disease burden in the most disadvantaged adults - many of whom are parents and grandparents.The impact goes further than academic progress, including the psychological effects of isolation and increased vulnerability to some children when they are never seen by adults outside their own household.</p><p>Returning to school is important for children psychologically and socially, as well as educationally and we should aim to support all year groups to return to school safely. In vulnerable households or where there is a history of domestic abuse it is even more important.</p><p>We therefore raise the possibility of using a wide range of empty facilities - private schools, sports facilities as examples - to allow those most in need of face-to-face education and social support to receive it, not only during the summer school term but also over summer holidays. This could be in the form of summer camps where social and physical development would be supported, with some education where possible.</p></div><section class="fnlist" role="doc-footnotes"></section>
