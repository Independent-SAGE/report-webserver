A risk assessment should follow <strong>full engagement with local authorities, school managers, trade unions, parents, inspectors, staff and the community. </strong>The assessment process needs to be understood and tailored to the risks and contexts of communities and their members and to the feasibility of schools to implement appropriate infection control procedures. This includes the different risks from lessons in different subjects (e.g. where there is sharing of equipment) and the ability to socially distance within schools. Consideration should be given to use of non-school facilities which may provide a better infection control environment, such as independent school buildings and playing fields, and sports facilities and football stadiums, which will be unused during this time. Such engagement will ensure an optimal solution to providing high quality education, social interaction and physical activities to children. The ability to be outside or in very well ventilated buildings or marquees will be associated with reduced infection rates.</p><h2 id="H3757237">5.2 Are local infections low enough?</h2><p>Local communities need to be sure that there are <strong>few people currently infected and that numbers of new infections are decreasing</strong>, with the definition of ‘few’ considered in the context of declines locally over the previous 2 weeks and numbers at the peak of the pandemic. Such data may not be available; data access and public availability is a critical gap in the current management of the pandemic.<br></p><h2 id="H7587259">5.3 Hygiene and personal protection</h2><p>Schools need to ensure adequate access for hand hygiene including sufficient and clean toilets and wash facilities and hand sanitisers. As well as social distancing, some schools in countries such as France and China are making the use of face coverings compulsory.</p><p>Children should be given designated equipment including stationary to reduce the risk of contagion spread.</p><h2 id="H7418697">5.4 Find cases, test, trace, isolate.</h2><p>A <strong>test, trace, isolate (TTI) infrastructure </strong>can rapidly suppress transmission, as well as provide confidence to staff, pupils, families and the local community that there will not be new uncontrolled local outbreaks. In the absence of a top-down, well-functioning system, which is not expected to be in place in the very near future, we recommend <strong>local solutions to TTI, linked to local public health authorities and primary care, but with systems in place to allow as near as possible to for local data to contribute to national data collection</strong>. This could involve wider testing of staff and pupils in schools to quickly identify asymptomatic infections, within an ethical, appropriate and agreed structure.</p></div><section class="fnlist" role="doc-footnotes"></section>
